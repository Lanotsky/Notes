# Web Design For non Designers
##### Notes from Coding Tech talk

1. Cut down on clutter
2. Use Grid. Not excatly css grid, but Line things up
3. Colors. Keep colors complementary, colors that are across together in the color wheel. See [The simple Web Developer's Color Guid](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/04/web-developer-guide-color/) or Refactoring UI (https://refactoringui.com/)
4. Fonts. When using fonts use a *few* different fonts and minimize silly looking fonts. Again see the following sites for [Typewolf)(https://www.typewolf.com/) Also Make that font perfectly responsive
5. IMGs. Less stock photos, and retina images as well
6. Steal Iteas. Good ideas
7. Draw out your design first on paper
